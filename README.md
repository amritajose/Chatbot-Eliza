# Chatbot

The chatbot Eliza in this program, is a psychotherapist that was initially developed by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT, Cambridge. The application made use of pattern matching and substitution methodology with interaction directives written as scripts using MAD-Slip.

This program is an attempt to implement Eliza using Python scripts. The program makes use of word spotting and keyword identification techniques in order to generate meaningful responses to the input. It also transforms statements from the user to questions wherever necessary to convince the user to engage in relevant
conversations. 

The chatbot spots words related to user's greetings, name, request(please), need, words related to user's family, words related to user's emotions(love/hate), definite answers (Yes/No), sorry, thank you etc. It converts statements regarding user's emotions (happy/sad/angry/love/hatred and so on) 
and relationships (father/mother/husband/wife/child and so on) to questions.
